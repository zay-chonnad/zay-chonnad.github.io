In 2004, Paraguay signed the world’s first country-level zero-deforestation law, and the goal of this research project is to explore how this agreement impacted land prices and understand how this policy affects large- and small-scale farmers differently.\n- Analyzed 2,000 Paraguayan property ads on Clasipar for identifiable features with which to find them on an aerial map.\n- Geo-referenced these property boundaries on Arc GIS Pro by overlaying property image and mapping 6-10 control points.\n- Presented on research project and methods used to peers and advisors at end-of-summer banquet and a fall symposium."
